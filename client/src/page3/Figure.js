          Every figure, including photos, should have a brief title written beneath it in strong e.g. Figure 1. Name of the figure, lowercase  numbers, numbered consecutively in the order that they occur in the text. Don't present the same information twice in a figure and the text. You need to obtain formal consent from the figure's publisher before using any figure that was taken straight out of previously published materials for reprinting. Your essay must be submitted with a copy of that permission release
