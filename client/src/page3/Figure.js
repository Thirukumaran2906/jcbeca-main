          Each figure, including photos, should have a brief title written beneath it in bold, e.g., "Figure 1. Name of the figure," with figures numbered consecutively in the order they appear in the text using lowercase numbers. Avoid presenting the same information in both the figure and the text. If you are using a figure from previously published materials, you must obtain formal consent from the original publisher before reprinting. A copy of this permission must be submitted along with your manuscript.
