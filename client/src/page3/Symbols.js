          Use only standard abbreviations. In an engineering journal, symbols and abbreviations play a crucial role in conveying complex technical information succinctly and clearly. To ensure their effective use, it is important to adhere to standardized symbols and abbreviations recognized in the field, such as those set by IEEE or ISO. Authors should include a dedicated section listing all symbols and abbreviations used in the paper, providing clear definitions for each. Additionally, symbols and abbreviations should be defined at their first occurrence in the text to aid reader comprehension. When used in tables, figures, and equations, their meanings should be clearly indicated either in the captions or footnotes. This approach ensures that readers can easily understand and follow the technical content, maintaining the clarity and precision essential in engineering communication.
