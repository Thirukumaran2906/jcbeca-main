          The literature survey in an article is a critical component that provides context and background, demonstrating the researcher's understanding of the field and highlighting the relevance of the current study. Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas lacking sufficient research. Explain how the reviewed literature relates to and supports the current research. Justify the need for the current study based on the identified gaps and the state of research. The literature survey should culminate in a critical analysis and synthesis of the reviewed studies, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, and providing a cohesive understanding of the topic.
