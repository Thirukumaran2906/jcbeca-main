          <p>
          A short communication in a journal is a concise scientific article that presents significant, new findings or developments in a specific field of research. These articles are brief, typically ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 words, and focus on a single aspect of the research, such as novel techniques, preliminary results, or unique observations. The purpose of a short communication is to rapidly disseminate noteworthy advancements to the scientific community. While they follow a similar structure to full-length articles, including sections like the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion, each section is much more succinct. The expedited review and publication process for short communications ensures that important discoveries can quickly reach researchers and practitioners, fostering timely scientific dialogue and progress. The following order should be used for this section: Abstract, Introduction, Materials and techniques, Discussion and Results (all together). There shouldn't be more than 12 references listed. The arrangement of tables, figures, and references should follow that of research publications.
