          <p>
          The proposed method or model section should comprehensively describe the new approach while maintaining clarity and precision. The objective of the proposed approach should be clearly stated, establishing the goals and expected outcomes. The method or model must include, incorporating key components, algorithms, or processes, and utilizing diagrams, flowcharts, or schematics to aid in visualization. The theoretical basis underlying the method, including relevant principles, theories, and assumptions, should be presented, along with any necessary mathematical formulations or equations. The implementation details should specify the tools, technologies, or software used, as well as any hardware requirements, ensuring that the methodology can be replicated. Validation methods must be discussed, detailing how the proposed approach is tested and verified, including data sets, simulations, or experimental setups employed. A comparative analysis with existing methods is essential to demonstrate the improvements or unique features of the new approach, supported by metrics or criteria used for evaluation. The advantages and potential limitations of the proposed method, providing a balanced view of its capabilities and challenges.
