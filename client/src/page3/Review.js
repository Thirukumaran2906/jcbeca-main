          <p>
          Review articles should not be more than 25 pages and contain comprehensive coverage of relevant literature. A review article in a journal is a comprehensive synthesis and critical analysis of existing research on a particular topic. Unlike original research articles that present new experimental or theoretical results, review articles summarize and evaluate the findings from multiple studies, providing an overview of the current state of knowledge in the field. These articles often highlight key advancements, identify trends, and discuss the implications of the research, as well as gaps and future directions. Review articles are valuable resources for researchers, practitioners, and students as they consolidate a vast amount of information into a coherent narrative, making it easier to understand complex subjects and stay up-to-date with the latest developments. They are typically written by experts with extensive knowledge of the topic, and they serve as authoritative sources that guide further research and practice.
