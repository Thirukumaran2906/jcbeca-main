          Put together a 150â€“250 word abstract on a first page in Italics and Bold font. An accurate and precise abstract is needed. An informative and entirely self-explanatory abstract, it should briefly introduce the subject, specify the parameters of the experiments, highlight noteworthy results, and draw important conclusions. It is best to utilise standard terminology and stay away from references and abbreviations.
