          Put together a 150â€“250 word abstract on a first page and mentioned in Italics and Bold font. An accurate and succinct abstract is needed. An informative and fully self-explanatory abstract should briefly introduce the subject, specify the parameters of the experiments, highlight noteworthy results, and draw important conclusions. Because of this, it is best to utilise standard terminology and stay away from references and abbreviations.
