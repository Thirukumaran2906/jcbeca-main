      The authors who plan to use human subjects or experimental animals in their research must obtain permission from the relevant Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. A declaration proving that informed permission was acquired and the investigation was approved should be included in the material and methods section of the paper. The integrity of the research process, which includes preventing plagiarism, fabricating or manipulating data, and guaranteeing appropriate authorship credit, is another aspect of ethical concerns.
