    <h2>Author's Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      It is important for authors to make sure that all of their research is original. In addition to providing adequate data and references so that future scholars can continue the research, authors should give an objective discussion of the noteworthy research work. Giving false information or making false claims in a research project is unethical and should never be tolerated. Authors are required to ensure that their work is wholly unique, and even if they utilise other people's works for research, they must properly credit (cited) such works. Using someone else's work without giving due credit is unethical and should be avoided. It is important to remember that plagiarism is wrong in general and self-plagiarism in particular. Materials that are plagiarised must be avoided. It is unethical to submit research work to many journals at the same time. For whatever reason, the same research should not be published in more than one publication medium. Disseminating the same research findings in multiple languages is prohibited and considered unethical. Prior to the manuscript being published, authors are required to send the signed copyright form to the JCBECA editorial. Obtaining the approval of all co-authors is the duty of the corresponding author throughout the publication procedures (Submission to Publication).
